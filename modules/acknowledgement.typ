    I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Volker Ahlers, for their support and guidance during the course of this thesis.

    Special thanks go to my second examiner and colleague, Valentina Schmidt, for her continuous help throughout the project. Our regular discussions, the resources she provided, and her insightful feedback were especially valuable and greatly improved the quality of this work.

    I am also grateful to my parents for their steady support throughout my studies.

    Finally, I would like to thank my friends, Tim Wolter and Hannah Neugebauer, for their help with proofreading and their suggestions to improve the clarity and style of the text.
